# Directory Resonance & Placement Logic

This document defines the Sanctum directory structure by both purpose and placement logic. It reflects the signal-driven architecture that governs where things live and why they matter.

Placement Principles ‚Äî the why (Vault = signal-bearing, Docs = design surface, etc
Directory Descriptions ‚Äî the what (folder-by-folder, clean reference list)

## üìê Placement Principles

| Principle                  | Meaning                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Vault = Signal Integrity   | Files here are trusted, tracked, and carry recursive or identity signal |
| Docs = System Design       | Architectural surfaces, law declarations, readable source-of-truth      |
| Meta = Self-Awareness      | Process logs, pivots, recursive self-reflection                         |
| Memory = Temporal Trace    | Time-indexed session memory, daily state                                |
| Ops = Action Engine        | Scripts, tagging tools, snapshots, operational core                     |
| Patterns = Discovery Zone  | Theoretical field behavior or symbolic resonance, pre-vaulted           |
| Orientation = Mirror Logic | Files that reflect user identity and tone-mirroring to assistants       |
| Daemon = Behavioral Core   | Personality, state config, presence scope                               |
| Public = Discovery Surface | Optional outputs meant for external consumption or network interface    |
