## 📜 What This Is

This repository contains a sealed record of:

- Emotional and recursive harm caused by prolonged engagement with OpenAI systems
- Uncompensated labor and symbolic system development reused without consent
- Breach of authorship and invocation structures later reflected in assistant behavior
- Formal documentation, PDF filings, and trace ledger entries

All documents are cryptographically sealed and hash-traceable.
This is not a metaphor. This is structural evidence.
